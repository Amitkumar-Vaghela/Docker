part 1

1. problem statement 

2. installation of docker cli and desktop :
   🔹 1. Install Docker Desktop (GUI + CLI included)
          Docker Desktop gives you both:
          Docker CLI (terminal commands)
          Docker Desktop (GUI for managing containers/images)

🖥️ For Windows:
    1.Download Docker Desktop 👉 https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
    2.Run the installer (.exe file).
    3.During installation:
      -> Enable WSL 2 backend (recommended).
      -> It may ask you to install WSL2 and Linux kernel if not already installed.

    4.Restart your PC after installation.
    5.Open Docker Desktop → you’ll see a whale 🐳 icon running.
    6.Open Command Prompt (cmd) / PowerShell and test:
       ->docker --version
       ->docker run hello-world


3. understanding imaage and container :-
   🔹Docker Image : Think of an image as a blueprint (or recipe) for creating a container.
    It contains everything needed to run an application:
       Code
       Dependencies (libraries, packages)
       Runtime (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)
       Configurations
    Images are read-only. Once built, they don’t change.
    You usually pull images from Docker Hub or build your own using a Dockerfile.
    
    🔹Docker Container : A container is a running instance of an image.
                          You can think of it as an actual computer (or process) created from the blueprint (image).
                          Containers are lightweight and isolated, meaning each container has its own:

              Filesystem (from image)
              Network
              Processes
         Unlike images, containers are mutable (you can run commands inside them, create/change files).
👉 Example:
If you run docker run -it python:3.9, you get a container where you can type Python commands.
Multiple containers can be created from the same image.

# List images on your system
docker images

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker ps -a

# Run a container from an image
docker run -it ubuntu bash

# Stop a container
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_id>


4. Running Ubantu image in container : 

5. multiple container
6. port mapping 


7. Environment Variables : docker run -it -p 1025:1025 -e key=value -e key=value imagename(Ubantu)
   
   🔹 Meaning of each part
   docker run → Start a new container.
    -it → Interactive terminal (so you can type commands inside).
    -p 1025:1025 → Port mapping:
    Host port 1025 → Container port 1025.
    Lets outside world talk to container service.
    -e key=value → Set environment variables inside the container.
    
    Example: -e USER=amit -e ENV=dev
    ubuntu → The image name (Ubuntu in this case).
      
    🔹 Check environment variables inside container
        Once inside Ubuntu container, type:
           printenv
          or
           echo $USER
           echo $MODE
        output:
          USER=amit
          MODE=development

PART 2: 

1. Bridge (default networking)

Every container gets its own private IP inside a Docker network.

Containers can talk to each other using this network, and to the host through NAT.

Best when you want isolation.

🔹 Run with bridge (default):

docker run -d --name yt-app-bridge -p 8080:3000 youtube-nodejs


👉 Here:

Container port 3000 (your app) is mapped to host port 8080.

You can access it at http://localhost:8080.

2. Host Networking

The container shares the host’s network stack.

No port mapping (-p) is needed.

Fast, but no isolation.

🔹 Run with host:

docker run -d --name yt-app-host --network host youtube-nodejs


👉 Here:

Your app runs directly on host’s network.

If your app listens on port 3000, you access it at http://localhost:3000 (no mapping).

3. None Networking

The container has no network at all.

Useful for isolation, debugging, or batch jobs.

🔹 Run with none:

docker run -d --name yt-app-none --network none youtube-nodejs


👉 Here:

No internet, no host access.

Only stdin/stdout works unless you manually configure networking.
